This repository is all about me just trying out git for the first time and trying to understand its workflows. Am not yet there but its where am headed. I've outline a simple Fibonacci series that i have grasped.
From what I have gained so far, i can say that git has more pros than cons in the long run because it improves the efficiency of the project and this will result in higher quality product. It has a very interesting and manageable environment that allows multiple parties to work on the same project.
